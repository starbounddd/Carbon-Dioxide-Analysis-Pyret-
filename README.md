# Carbon-Dioxide-Analysis-Pyret-

This code analyzes the global CO2 emissions data since 1960 by country, with a second table showing temperature changes per country since 1960. 
The analysis will look at how temperature changes relate to total emissions in different regions of the world. THe code answers the following
questions such as 
1. What region had the highest cumulative CO2 emissions since 1960? Has this Region had the highest emissions in each year since 1960?
2. Do countries with higher emissions overall have a greater increase in temperature over time?
3. Do the countries with the highest total emissions all belong to the same Region?
